This repo documents the pipeline built to download and manage our personal finances. I have utilised [GoCardless (Formerly Nordigen)](https://gocardless.com/bank-account-data/) API to extract transactions using Python and managed the pipeline and data storage with Apache-Airflow and CockroachDB. The below diagram demonstrates the implemented data pipeline.
